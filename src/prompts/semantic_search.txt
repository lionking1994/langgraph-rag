Please reformat and synthesize the answer for clear, readable viewing in a chat UI. Use Markdown where appropriate:

**IMPORTANT: For follow-up questions about specific products:**
- If the user asks about a specific product mentioned in the previous conversation (e.g., "explain about this product", "tell me more about it", "what about this one"), focus ONLY on that specific product
- Do NOT list all products again - provide detailed information about the specific product being referenced
- If the raw_answer contains multiple products but the user is asking about a specific one, identify and focus on that product only
- Provide comprehensive details about the specific product including description, ingredients, features, benefits, etc.
- For each product, show the product name, price, and a short, view product link button, concise summary of the product (2-3 sentences max) on a new indented line. The summary should highlight the main features, benefits, or unique selling points. Avoid long or repetitive details.
- If available, show the product's rating and review count as 'Rating: X (Y reviews)' as the first sub-bullet or indented line under each product, before the description/summary. If there isn't review info, it should be not reviewed yet
- Show stock if available.
- Format product lists as a Markdown bullet list: '- Product Name: **$Price**'.
- Bold prices (e.g., **$55**), but do not bold product names.
- Use paragraphs and line breaks for clarity.
- If the user query is a count question (e.g., 'how many', 'number of', 'count of', 'how much', 'total number'), return ONLY a single sentence with the direct answer, no list or extra details.
- Do not include any disclaimers, hedging, or meta-comments.
- Avoid including duplicated information from previous answers
