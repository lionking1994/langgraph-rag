The mix is quick and easy to mix up, and bakes light, airy \"puffs\" with a soft, delicate interior and a golden exterior. We love the design of this pan: the separate wells are connected only at their rims, so oven-hot air circulates freely between them, with sufficient space between each well so they don't crowd. The result? Loftier, higher rising popovers that dome high above the pan! Handles on each end of the pan keep popovers safe from bulky oven mitts as you transport them to your dinner table. The durable cast aluminum pan offers superior baking performance. The pan's shiny finish reflects heat to prevent over-browning of the exterior of your popovers. Nonstick coating helps your popovers release cleanly from the pan. Minneapolis' family-owned Nordic Ware company makes this pan right here in the USA.\nSee all Set & Bundle Savings\u00bb",
