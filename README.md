## üß™ Testing
- Try a variety of queries (see above) and follow-up questions.
- Use the "Show LangGraph Flow Visualization" expander to see the reasoning flow.
- For database debugging, use `sqlite3 products.db` or a GUI like Navicat.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
- **No answer shown?** Check the backend logs and ensure the answer is being returned from the agent.
- **LLM errors?** Make sure your OpenAI API key is valid and you have internet access.
- **Database issues?** Re-run `python setup_db.py` to rebuild the database from `products.json`.
- **Dependency errors?** Double-check your `requirements.txt` and Python version.
