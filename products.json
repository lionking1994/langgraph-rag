With this pan, mix, and scoop set, anyone can bake hot, buttery, crisp, light-as-air popovers (everyone's favorite bread-basket treat!) at home. Use the scoop to get just the right amount of batter for each well (and to scoop more easily and efficiently). Standard popover pan yields delicious results. Six separate wells are connected only at their rims, so oven-hot air circulates freely between them, with sufficient space between each well so they don't crowd. The result? Loftier, higher rising popovers that dome 5\" above the pan! Handles on each end of the pan keep popovers safe from bulky oven mitts as you transport them to your dinner table. The durable cast aluminum pan offers superior baking performance. The pan's shiny finish reflects heat to prevent over-browning of the exterior of your popovers. Nonstick coating helps your popovers release cleanly from the pan. Minneapolis' family-owned Nordic Ware company makes this pan right here in the USA.\n\nVisit Us | Baker\u2019s Rewards\nVisit Us | Baker\u2019s Rewards\n|",

        "description": "Product information Description Specs Care & Storage Ingredients, Nutrition, and Allergens Save on this duo of popover essentials! Our delicious mix makes perfect popovers at home; we've paired it with our sturdy, go-to standard popover pan to make hot, buttery, crisp, light-as-air popovers (everyone's favorite bread-basket treat!) at home. The mix is quick and easy to mix up, and bakes light, airy \"puffs\" with a soft, delicate interior and a golden exterior. We love the design of this pan: the separate wells are connected only at their rims, so oven-hot air circulates freely between them, with sufficient space between each well so they don't crowd. The result? Loftier, higher rising popovers that dome high above the pan! Handles on each end of the pan keep popovers safe from bulky oven mitts as you transport them to your dinner table. The durable cast aluminum pan offers superior baking performance. The pan's shiny finish reflects heat to prevent over-browning of the exterior of your popovers. Nonstick coating helps your popovers release cleanly from the pan. Minneapolis' family-owned Nordic Ware company makes this pan right here in the USA.
